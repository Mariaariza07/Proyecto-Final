Good evening, Colombians. In 2021, Colombia saw, participated, witnessed, and was a protagonist in the social outburst. Some criticized, others supported.

In general, the youth of Colombia decided it was time to open opportunities for themselves and for the country. Alongside them gathered the indigenous people, alongside them gathered the workers, alongside them gathered the housewives from the popular neighborhoods, the young women, because they felt that after Covid, after the illness, after a government that, faced with the disease, wanted to impose taxes on soup and food, it was time, given so much inequality and hunger generated by injustice, by tyranny, and by the disease itself, to change Colombia.

Few, perhaps, understood that popular message. Perhaps all they thought in the heights of the government and the state at that time was that they had to kill, that they had to imprison thousands, that they had to take out eyes, that they had to poison popular neighborhoods with gas, that they had to teach that speaking is a sin and a crime, and they condemned them, even to prison, to death.

We perhaps did not understand as a society what the central message of that youth and that people meant, who from the corners of the big cities of Colombia came out to build a barricade and light a bonfire. Only later, just a few months later, and because we wanted there to be no violence in Colombia but rather peaceful paths to be opened, we have always believed that peace is the solution for Colombia, so we asked that same youth, that same people, to go to the polls and decide their future.

And they went, and they decided their future with peace, with hope, with joy, they voted for the change of Colombia. They not only mobilized but also voted, and for the first time in many decades, a progressive government was built, which, under my responsibility, has governed this country in recent years. We have not wanted to betray that illusion and that hope of the people.

The Social Reforms

It has been difficult, and it has been seen why, but hope is fundamental in a people who want to build themselves, in a nation that wants to be great, and that is why the reforms that the people asked for—that there be no slavery in the factory or the workshop, that women not be sexually harassed for wanting to work for an employer, for a bandit, that the elderly be given a plate of food and not die sadly in a market square or in a lonely park, perhaps intoxicated, alien to affection, sad and dying.

That women be given labor rights, that people who have been excluded, and they are the majority, from the possibility of the right to health could have a doctor who would come to their house, even if that house were located in the farthest place on the planet, in our country, the land. There, crossing a jungle, there in the desert, there in the place where the government has never looked, where an EPS (Health Promoting Entity) does not reach, there where the people of Colombia live, they wanted a reform where health, and therefore life, would be possible.

We presented those reforms to the Congress of the Republic two years ago. We asked the people of Colombia to support them, and we asked and requested consensus, a national agreement around the reforms.

What we received was mockery, deception, great protagonists, in quotation marks, of the Colombian oligarchy trying to prevent the reforms from being made in Colombia, trying to maintain the unjust order they left after Covid and that perhaps has already been a century in Colombia, two centuries. An order that has led us to be the most unequal country in the world, but that is also leading us, for the same reason, to be one of the most violent countries.

Life seems to escape in the country of life, in the country of beauty, where due to geological circumstances there is a kind of vital explosion of nature, but at the same time, the human beings who live in that vital explosion of greens, of nature and of life, kill each other exclusively out of greed.

And that death by greed is nothing more than self-destruction, the degeneration of our nation, the possibility of losing a homeland.

Social equality, social justice, environmental justice, rose as political flags and won the elections. And the people of Colombia, mostly in rural and urban areas, asked the state to build social justice, environmental justice.

And we said to the oligarchy, come, speak, let's talk, let's reach an agreement. Colombia cannot continue to be a society of slaves, of servants. Colombia has to be a society where the people can decide, because that is a democracy.

The Reforms in Congress

And we presented the projects to Congress after the mockery of the owners of the big press, of the owners of capital in Colombia, who live very well because they have concentrated the wealth of everyone in their hands.

The Congress of the Republic did a partial job. The House of Representatives approved all the reforms we presented to build social justice.

The reforms presented are not a whim of the president, they are not an ideological fancy, it is not true that they are an improvisation, the world has discussed them, and many countries are implementing them because the other idea created in 1993, that a market acting simply would guarantee the fundamental rights of every citizen of Colombia, has already failed, and it was not true.

Only a minority will be able to retire in this country if there is no pension reform. And why then can't we talk about the right to retire in Colombia, as it is talked about in most countries of the world? And why can't we think that there is a right to health and not just a business, and that a person who gets sick can be saved if science and technology allow it, and not die simply because they have to wait for a businessman to see if the costs of their illness are too high and their profits are reduced? To see if the factory stops being slavery, if work stops being slave labor.

How is it that Colombia has the highest working hours in the OECD and the lowest productivity? Who thought that in the 21st century, profits come from treating workers like slaves and making them work 12 hours, 13 hours, and not paying them their overtime, or their holiday work, or giving a woman the right to rest at home when she menstruates, because profits go down and the woman has to endure it?

Or that a young apprentice has to be treated almost without salary even though they work for a boss? The first job is not slavery, it is a right, and therefore it must be treated with the dignity of any worker, you are not a slave because you are young.

Or how do they dare say that employment ends if resident doctors receive a salary? What they are shouting in our faces today is that Colombia cannot be just. Some congressmen, even raising the cross, pray to the rich man and not to Jesus, the carpenter.

Some congressmen are tainted by greed because they receive money from those who are taking away the rights of the people, as happened with the owner of Colsánitas, completely breaking the constitution of Colombia.

What do we do then? It is not to go home, it is not to say that the young people who died in the social outburst died and goodbye. It is not to think that we have to mock the popular vote of 2022. No, ladies and gentlemen.

Let the People Decide

The country has to move forward with hope and with peace, with joy. Hope is fundamental, and that is why this government is not going to back down on the reforms, but without foolishness, because we already know that they sink them every time we present the reforms, because money is worth more than identity and the constitutional order to legislate in favor of the general interest. Some legislate in favor of business. Greed seizes their hearts, and greed kills life.

We have read laws, we have looked in the constitution for ways that allow the people to decide without intermediaries. Let the people decide if they want the pension reform or not, if they want the health reform or not, if they want the labor reform.

Practically, to call on the people to decide if they want to be slaves or want to be free and dignified. It is up to the people to make that decision, and to that extent, we have called on the people to the streets, to mobilize, to the woman who can receive a decent salary and not a three-month contract, to the young person who can have a first job with a real salary, to the street vendor, to the small businessman who know that if the people of Colombia have better incomes, they will sell more, and their company will be bigger.

The company is bigger not because workers' salaries are reduced, but because if the workers of Colombia have better salaries, they buy more. The company grows if it sells more, it is the law of capitalism, and that implies a decent salary, a decent working day, dignity.

I invite the people to mobilize, the indigenous people, to the streets, the peasantry, to the streets, because they want to keep them without a pension. To all the rural population who have had their health post taken away, who do not have a first-level hospital because they preferred to take public money to build golf courses in Miami and have a private jet.

They stole the money from health, and there are congressmen who want payments so that they can continue stealing the money from health. And what to think, then, of calling on the working people, the salaried people? Because having a decent salary is not a sin, it is dignity, and because Colombia can grow like this, through dignity.

We are Going to Convene a Popular Consultation

We are going to convene a popular consultation. It is the Senate in its plenary session, which they wanted to prevent from discussing the reforms by eight congressmen from the Seventh Commission, that must decide in a favorable opinion and in a single vote before a month.

The president of Colombia will present the call for a popular consultation for the social reforms that imply social justice in Colombia.

And that, that popular consultation starts now, with street mobilization. They mocked the national agreement, so let the people decide. The people are the basis of sovereignty, the people are the basis of institutionality, the people are the basis of democracy, says the Political Constitution of Colombia, and we are obeying the Constitution.

Therefore, if there is an institutional blockade against this government because they decided to mock the young people who came out in the social outburst of 2021, because they decided to mock the central message of the popular vote in the presidential elections of 2022, because they want to avoid reforming Colombia to make it just, alive, and in peace, then it is up to the people to break that institutional blockade.

An institutional blockade is a dictatorship of the establishment of the rich men of Colombia who want nothing but greed and selfishness.

Well, it is up to the people to break that dictatorship, to break the institutional blockade in which they have submerged the government like a pincer waiting to give the definitive coup d'état. No, what there will be is democracy, what there will be are changes and transformations, Colombia needs it, and therefore, from now on, not only mobilization, but also voting in the polls of the popular consultation if you want to be a slave or want to be free and dignified in productive work.

The popular consultation is mandatory once it passes through the Senate plenary. It is held within three months, and the Senate has a month to decide.

I ask the political parties not to heed the rich man, but as the Constitution orders, the general interest of Colombian society. If they deny the people of Colombia participation, they would be literally denying peace, and this in the 21st century is not the time for it. We have killed each other for generations.

It is the moment of peace, and the moment of peace its pages are written by the people of Colombia with their will to decide. So, welcome to the popular consultation for social reforms and welcome to the people of Colombia in the streets of all Colombia.

Thank you for listening to me.
